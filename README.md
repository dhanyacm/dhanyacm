### Being ME

# Hi, I’m Dhanya 👋

This GitHub is my **learning and experimentation space**.

I use it to:
- Practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Build small static websites and UI experiments
- Try ideas, layouts, and interactions
- Document what I learn along the way

Most repositories here are **learning projects**, not production-ready applications.

### Tech I explore
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Git & GitHub
- Static site structure & deployment

I believe in learning by building — even small, imperfect things.

📌 Some projects may look simple by design.
📌 Clarity and understanding matter more to me than polish.
