1) Wash and clean a widemouthed jar and remove all labels

2) Draw or paste your desired silhouette on the jar

3) Paste a tissue outside the jar to give it a frosted look. Tissue might wringle when you paste which is fine

4) Decorate with glitter or other embellishments of your choice. Here I have lightly painted with glitter dust and pasted the stars.

5) For the lid, pasted an invitation card to cover the prints and decorated it with net and heart embellishment
