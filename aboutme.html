									<p>  <strong> 
										I traveled a very atypical path, both personally and professionally.						
									</strong> <br />
									</p>
									
									<p> <strong> Personal Life </strong> <br />
										Born and brought up in Thrissur, one of the sleepy towns in the central part of Kerala in Southern India, also known as cultural capital of Kerala.
										Both my parents were govt servants and gave more importance to education and encouraged me secure a job rather than getting married which is the norm in this part of the world. 
										Of course they had their concerns later when I decided not to get married just for the sake of it and wait until I am fully ready and convinced that made many eyes roll. 
										Anyway I guess the grooming in initial days probably made me very 'un-girly' ;)										
									</p>
									
									<p> <strong> Education and Career </strong> <br />
										I’ve always loved solving problems. Being good at maths and science, I graduated as an electronics and communications engineer and is working in the Telecom industry ever since.
										I have worked with many of the telecom majors. Started my career with Siemens Communications Systems which was a part of Siemens AG which got merged with Nokia Systems to be Nokia Siemens Networks.
										Later I moved on to the startup space for a brief time and worked in the Cloud and IoT space before moving back to Telecom and is now working for Ericsson in their NFV-Mano space
									</p>
									
									<p>  <strong>Hobbies and Interests </strong> <br />
										My work took me to different places which kind of broke the initial resitance to go out and explore as a single women and gradually I developed a craze for travelling. I also managed to create a likeminded group of friends and we have managed to explore quite many places together<br>
										The urge to capture the beauty around me during these journeys is what took me to photography and I believe it can tell stories beyond the obvious <br>
										Being an only child, journeling was my way of expressiong my emotions and that is what got evolved to blogging. I like to write about what I do in life , my thoughts , my dreams and many more silly things...<br>
										And yes I also like to do all sorts of arts and crafts so that I don't get bored at home (except that I may not stick to one)<br>
										And very recently , I learned web development out of curiosity and now enjoy doing static websites for friends and family.

									<p>  <strong>Dreams and Future </strong> <br />
										“Travel makes one modest. You see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.” <br>
										 - Gustav Flaubert
										<br> <br>
										Travel will continue to top my list and I belive you need not quit your day job to travel. You will always have responsibilities and there will always be reasons not to take some time out. But take that extra effort and go exploring
										<br>
										I thought I need to list down the stuff I would like to do in life so that I can tick them off 
										This being in public domain should help me do it sooner than later ;)
