									<p>  <strong> 
										I traveled a very atypical path, both personally and professionally.						
									</strong> <br />
									</p>
									
									<p> <strong> Personal Life </strong> <br />
										Born and brought up in Thrissur one of the sleepy towns in the central part of Kerala in Southern India also known as cultural capital of Kerala.
										Both my parents were govt servants and gave more importance to education and encouraged me secure a job rather than getting married which is the norm in this part of the world. Of course they had their concerns later which every parents of a girl child can have.
										But the grooming in initial days probably made me very 'un girly' ;)
										
									</p>
									
									<p> <strong> Education and Career </strong> <br />
										I’ve always loved solving problems. Being good at maths and science, I graduated as an electronics and communications engineer and is working in the Telecom industry ever since.
										I have worked with many of the telecom majors. Started my career with Siemens Communications Systems which was a part of Siemens AG which got merged with Nokia Systems to be Nokia Siemens Networks.
										Later I moved on to the startup space for a brief time and worked in teh Cloud and IoT space before moving back to Telecom again and is now working with the Ericsson in the NFV-Mano space
										I learned web development out of curiosity and enjoy doing static websites for friends and family.
										If you want, you can view my LinkedIn profile

									<p>  <strong>Hobbies and Interests </strong> <br />
										My work took me to different places which kind of broke the initial resitance to go out and explore as a single women and gradually I developed a craze for travelling and also managed to create a likeminded group of friends who were in to it together<br>
										The urge to capture the beauty around me during these journeys is what took me to photography which I believe can tell stories beyond the obvious<br>
										Sometimes I like to write about what I do in life and at work. Being an only child, journeling was my way of expressiong my emotions and that is what got evolved to blogging.

									<p>  <strong>Dreams and Future </strong> <br />
										“Travel makes one modest. You see what a tiny place you occupy in the world.”
										 - Gustav Flaubert
										Travel will continue to top this list and I belive you need to quit your day job to travel. You will always have responsibilities and there will always be reasons not to take some time out. But take time out to explore
										My bucketlist here :)
