									<p>
										I traveled a very atypical path, both personally and professionally.						
									
									</p>
									
									<p> <strong> Personal Life </strong> <br />
										Born and brought up in Thrissur one of the sleepy towns in the central part of Kerala in Southern India also known as cultural capital of Kerala.
										Both my parents were govt servants and gave more importance to education and encouraged me secure a job  
										
									</p>
									
									<p> <strong> Education and Career </strong> <br />
										Iâ€™ve always loved solving problems. Being good at maths and science, I graduated as an electronics and communications engineer and is working in the Telecom industry ever since.
										I have worked with many of the telecom majors. Started my career with Siemens Communications Systems which was a part of Siemens AG which got merged with Nokia Systems to be Nokia Siemens Networks.
										Later I moved on to the startup space for a brief time and worked in teh Cloud and IoT space before moving back to Telecom again and is now working with the Ericsson in the NFV-Mano space
										I learned web development out of curiosity and enjoy doing static websites for friends and family.
										If you want, you can view my LinkedIn profile

									<p>  <strong>Hobbies and Interests </strong> <br />
										My work took me to different places which kind of broke the initial resitance to go out and explore as a single women and gradually I developed a craze for travelling<br>
										The urge to capture the beauty around me during these journeys is what took me to photography which I believe can tell stories beyond the obvious<br>
										Sometimes I like to write about what I do in life and at work a habit I developed from early years to vent out my emotions.
										From childhood I was passionate about all sorts of arts and crafts and it is my dream to have an artisan community who can collaborate support each other and grow individually as a personal brand. Working towards this dream
